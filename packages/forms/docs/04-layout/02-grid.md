title: Grid
---

## Overview

Filament's grid system allows you to create responsive, multi-column layouts using any layout component.

## Responsively setting the number of grid columns

All layout components have a `columns()` method that you can use in a couple of different ways:

- You can pass an integer like `columns(2)`. This integer is the number of columns used on the `lg` breakpoint and higher. All smaller devices will have just 1 column.
- You can pass an array, where the key is the breakpoint and the value is the number of columns. For example, `columns(['md' => 2, 'xl' => 4])` will create a 2 column layout on medium devices, and a 4 column layout on extra large devices. The default breakpoint for smaller devices uses 1 column, unless you use a `default` array key.

Breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`) are defined by Tailwind, and can be found in the [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview).

## Controlling how many columns a component should span

In addition to specifying how many columns a layout component should have, you may also specify how many columns a component should fill within the parent grid, using the `columnSpan()` method. This method accepts an integer or an array of breakpoints and column spans:

- `columnSpan(2)` will make the component fill up to 2 columns on all breakpoints.
- `columnSpan(['md' => 2, 'xl' => 4])` will make the component fill up to 2 columns on medium devices, and up to 4 columns on extra large devices. The default breakpoint for smaller devices uses 1 column, unless you use a `default` array key.
- `columnSpan('full')` or `columnSpanFull()` or `columnSpan(['default' => 'full'])` will make the component fill the full width of the parent grid, regardless of how many columns it has.

## An example of a responsive grid layout

In this example, we have a form with a [section](section) layout component. Since all layout components support the `columns()` method, we can use it to create a responsive grid layout within the section itself.

We pass an array to `columns()` as we want to specify different numbers of columns for different breakpoints. On devices smaller than the `sm` [Tailwind breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview), we want to have 1 column, which is default. On devices larger than the `sm` breakpoint, we want to have 3 columns. On devices larger than the `xl` breakpoint, we want to have 6 columns. On devices larger than the `2xl` breakpoint, we want to have 8 columns.

Inside the section, we have a [text input](../fields/text-input). Since text inputs are form components and all form components have a `columnSpan()` method, we can use it to specify how many columns the text input should fill. On devices smaller than the `sm` breakpoint, we want the text input to fill 1 column, which is default. On devices larger than the `sm` breakpoint, we want the text input to fill 2 columns. On devices larger than the `xl` breakpoint, we want the text input to fill 3 columns. On devices larger than the `2xl` breakpoint, we want the text input to fill 4 columns.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Section::make()
    ->columns([
        'sm' => 3,
        'xl' => 6,
        '2xl' => 8,
    ])
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')
            ->columnSpan([
                'sm' => 2,
                'xl' => 3,
                '2xl' => 4,
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

## Grid component

All layout components support the `columns()` method, but you also have access to an additional `Grid` component. If you feel that your form schema would benefit from an explicit grid syntax with no extra styling, it may be useful to you. Instead of using the `columns()` method, you can pass your column configuration directly to `Grid::make()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Grid;

Grid::make([
    'default' => 1,
    'sm' => 2,
    'md' => 3,
    'lg' => 4,
    'xl' => 6,
    '2xl' => 8,
])
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

## Setting the starting column of a component in a grid

If you want to start a component in a grid at a specific column, you can use the `columnStart()` method. This method accepts an integer, or an array of breakpoints and which column the component should start at:

- `columnStart(2)` will make the component start at column 2 on all breakpoints.
- `columnStart(['md' => 2, 'xl' => 4])` will make the component start at column 2 on medium devices, and at column 4 on extra large devices. The default breakpoint for smaller devices uses 1 column, unless you use a `default` array key.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;

Section::make()
    ->columns([
        'sm' => 3,
        'xl' => 6,
        '2xl' => 8,
    ])
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')
            ->columnStart([
                'sm' => 2,
                'xl' => 3,
                '2xl' => 4,
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

In this example, the grid has 3 columns on small devices, 6 columns on extra large devices, and 8 columns on extra extra large devices. The text input will start at column 2 on small devices, column 3 on extra large devices, and column 4 on extra extra large devices. This is essentially producing a layout whereby the text input always starts halfway through the grid, regardless of how many columns the grid has.

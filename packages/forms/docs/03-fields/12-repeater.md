## Overview

The repeater component allows you to output a JSON array of repeated form components.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')->required(),
        Select::make('role')
            ->options([
                'member' => 'Member',
                'administrator' => 'Administrator',
                'owner' => 'Owner',
            ])
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->columns(2)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/simple" alt="Repeater" version="3.x" />

We recommend that you store repeater data with a `JSON` column in your database. Additionally, if you're using Eloquent, make sure that column has an `array` cast.

As evident in the above example, the component schema can be defined within the `schema()` method of the component:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')->required(),
        // ...
    ])
```

If you wish to define a repeater with multiple schema blocks that can be repeated in any order, please use the [builder](builder).

## Setting empty default items

Repeaters may have a certain number of empty items created by default, using the `defaultItems()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->defaultItems(3)
```

Note that these default items are only created when the form is loaded without existing data. Inside [panel resources](../../panels/resources#resource-forms) this only works on Create Pages, as Edit Pages will always fill the data from the model.

## Adding items

An action button is displayed below the repeater to allow the user to add a new item.

## Setting the add action button's label

You may set a label to customize the text that should be displayed in the button for adding a repeater item, using the `addActionLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->addActionLabel('Add member')
```

### Preventing the user from adding items

You may prevent the user from adding items to the repeater using the `addable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->addable(false)
```

## Deleting items

An action button is displayed on each item to allow the user to delete it.

### Preventing the user from deleting items

You may prevent the user from deleting items from the repeater using the `deletable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->deletable(false)
```

## Reordering items

A button is displayed on each item to allow the user to drag and drop to reorder it in the list.

### Preventing the user from reordering items

You may prevent the user from reordering items from the repeater using the `reorderable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->reorderable(false)
```

### Reordering items with buttons

You may use the `reorderableWithButtons()` method to enable reordering items with buttons to move the item up and down:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->reorderableWithButtons()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/reorderable-with-buttons" alt="Repeater that is reorderable with buttons" version="3.x" />

### Preventing reordering with drag and drop

You may use the `reorderableWithDragAndDrop(false)` method to prevent items from being ordered with drag and drop:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->reorderableWithDragAndDrop(false)
```

## Collapsing items

The repeater may be `collapsible()` to optionally hide content in long forms:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsible()
```

You may also collapse all items by default:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsed()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/collapsed" alt="Collapsed repeater" version="3.x" />

## Cloning items

You may allow repeater items to be duplicated using the `cloneable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->cloneable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/cloneable" alt="Cloneable repeater" version="3.x" />

## Integrating with an Eloquent relationship

> If you're building a form inside your Livewire component, make sure you have set up the [form's model](../adding-a-form-to-a-livewire-component#setting-a-form-model). Otherwise, Filament doesn't know which model to use to retrieve the relationship from.

You may employ the `relationship()` method of the `Repeater` to configure a `HasMany` relationship. Filament will load the item data from the relationship, and save it back to the relationship when the form is submitted. If a custom relationship name is not passed to `relationship()`, Filament will use the field name as the relationship name:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

When using `disabled()` with `relationship()`, ensure that `disabled()` is called before `relationship()`. This ensures that the `dehydrated()` call from within `relationship()` is not overridden by the call from `disabled()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->disabled()
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

### Reordering items in a relationship

By default, [reordering](#reordering-items) relationship repeater items is disabled. This is because your related model needs a `sort` column to store the order of related records. To enable reordering, you may use the `orderColumn()` method, passing in a name of the column on your related model to store the order in:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->orderColumn('sort')
```

If you use something like [`spatie/eloquent-sortable`](https://github.com/spatie/eloquent-sortable) with an order column such as `order_column`, you may pass this in to `orderColumn()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->orderColumn('order_column')
```

### Integrating with a `BelongsToMany` Eloquent relationship

There is a common misconception that using a `BelongsToMany` relationship with a repeater is as simple as using a `HasMany` relationship. This is not the case, as a `BelongsToMany` relationship requires a pivot table to store the relationship data. The repeater saves its data to the related model, not the pivot table. Therefore, if you want to map each repeater item to a row in the pivot table, you must use a `HasMany` relationship with a pivot model to use a repeater with a `BelongsToMany` relationship.

Imagine you have a form to create a new `Order` model. Each order belongs to many `Product` models, and each product belongs to many orders. You have a `order_product` pivot table to store the relationship data. Instead of using the `products` relationship with the repeater, you should create a new relationship called `orderProducts` on the `Order` model, and use that with the repeater:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasMany;

public function orderProducts(): HasMany
{
    return $this->hasMany(OrderProduct::class);
}
```

If you don't already have an `OrderProduct` pivot model, you should create that, with inverse relationships to `Order` and `Product`:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\Pivot;

class OrderProduct extends Pivot
{
    public function order(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Order::class);
    }

    public function product(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Product::class);
    }
}
```

> Please ensure that your pivot model has a primary key column, like `id`, to allow Filament to keep track of which repeater items have been created, updated and deleted.

Now you can use the `orderProducts` relationship with the repeater, and it will save the data to the `order_product` pivot table:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Repeater::make('orderProducts')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        Select::make('product_id')
            ->relationship('product', 'name')
            ->required(),
        // ...
    ])
```

### Mutating related item data before filling the field

You may mutate the data for a related item before it is filled into the field using the `mutateRelationshipDataBeforeFillUsing()` method. This method accepts a closure that receives the current item's data in a `$data` variable. You must return the modified array of data:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->mutateRelationshipDataBeforeFillUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

        return $data;
    })
```

### Mutating related item data before creating

You may mutate the data for a new related item before it is created in the database using the `mutateRelationshipDataBeforeCreateUsing()` method. This method accepts a closure that receives the current item's data in a `$data` variable. You can choose to return either the modified array of data, or `null` to prevent the item from being created:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->mutateRelationshipDataBeforeCreateUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

        return $data;
    })
```

### Mutating related item data before saving

You may mutate the data for an existing related item before it is saved in the database using the `mutateRelationshipDataBeforeSaveUsing()` method. This method accepts a closure that receives the current item's data in a `$data` variable. You can choose to return either the modified array of data, or `null` to prevent the item from being saved:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->mutateRelationshipDataBeforeSaveUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

        return $data;
    })
```

## Grid layout

You may organize repeater items into columns by using the `grid()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->grid(2)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/grid" alt="Repeater with a 2 column grid of items" version="3.x" />

This method accepts the same options as the `columns()` method of the [grid](../layout/grid). This allows you to responsively customize the number of grid columns at various breakpoints.

## Adding a label to repeater items based on their content

You may add a label for repeater items using the `itemLabel()` method. This method accepts a closure that receives the current item's data in a `$state` variable. You must return a string to be used as the item label:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')
            ->required()
            ->live(onBlur: true),
        Select::make('role')
            ->options([
                'member' => 'Member',
                'administrator' => 'Administrator',
                'owner' => 'Owner',
            ])
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->columns(2)
    ->itemLabel(fn (array $state): ?string => $state['name'] ?? null),
```

Any fields that you use from `$state` should be `live()` if you wish to see the item label update live as you use the form.

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/labelled" alt="Repeater with item labels" version="3.x" />

## Simple repeaters with one field

You can use the `simple()` method to create a repeater with a single field, using a minimal design

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Repeater::make('invitations')
    ->simple(
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->email()
            ->required(),
    )
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/simple-one-field" alt="Simple repeater design with only one field" version="3.x" />

Instead of using a nested array to store data, simple repeaters use a flat array of values. This means that the data structure for the above example could look like this:

```php
[
    'invitations' => [
        'dan@filamentphp.com',
        'ryan@filamentphp.com',
    ],
],
```

## Using `$get()` to access parent field values

All form components are able to [use `$get()` and `$set()`](../advanced) to access another field's value. However, you might experience unexpected behavior when using this inside the repeater's schema.

This is because `$get()` and `$set()`, by default, are scoped to the current repeater item. This means that you are able to interact with another field inside that repeater item easily without knowing which repeater item the current form component belongs to.

The consequence of this is that you may be confused when you are unable to interact with a field outside the repeater. We use `../` syntax to solve this problem - `$get('../../parent_field_name')`.

Consider your form has this data structure:

```php
[
    'client_id' => 1,

    'repeater' => [
        'item1' => [
            'service_id' => 2,
        ],
    ],
]
```

You are trying to retrieve the value of `client_id` from inside the repeater item.

`$get()` is relative to the current repeater item, so `$get('client_id')` is looking for `$get('repeater.item1.client_id')`.

You can use `../` to go up a level in the data structure, so `$get('../client_id')` is `$get('repeater.client_id')` and `$get('../../client_id')` is `$get('client_id')`.

The special case of `$get()` with no arguments, or `$get('')` or `$get('./')`, will always return the full data array for the current repeater item.

## Repeater validation

As well as all rules listed on the [validation](../validation) page, there are additional rules that are specific to repeaters.

### Number of items validation

You can validate the minimum and maximum number of items that you can have in a repeater by setting the `minItems()` and `maxItems()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->minItems(2)
    ->maxItems(5)
```

### Distinct state validation

In many cases, you will want to ensure some sort of uniqueness between repeater items. A couple of common examples could be:

- Ensuring that only one [checkbox](checkbox) or [toggle](toggle) is activated at once across items in the repeater.
- Ensuring that an option may only be selected once across [select](select), [radio](radio), [checkbox list](checkbox-list), or [toggle buttons](toggle-buttons) fields in a repeater.

You can use the `distinct()` method to validate that the state of a field is unique across all items in the repeater:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('answers')
    ->schema([
        // ...
        Checkbox::make('is_correct')
            ->distinct(),
    ])
```

The behavior of the `distinct()` validation depends on the data type that the field handles

- If the field returns a boolean, like a [checkbox](checkbox) or [toggle](toggle), the validation will ensure that only one item has a value of `true`. There may be many fields in the repeater that have a value of `false`.
- Otherwise, for fields like a [select](select), [radio](radio), [checkbox list](checkbox-list), or [toggle buttons](toggle-buttons), the validation will ensure that each option may only be selected once across all items in the repeater.

#### Automatically fixing indistinct state

If you'd like to automatically fix indistinct state, you can use the `fixIndistinctState()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('answers')
    ->schema([
        // ...
        Checkbox::make('is_correct')
            ->fixIndistinctState(),
    ])
```

This method will automatically enable the `distinct()` and `live()` methods on the field.

Depending on the data type that the field handles, the behavior of the `fixIndistinctState()` adapts:

- If the field returns a boolean, like a [checkbox](checkbox) or [toggle](toggle), and one of the fields is enabled, Filament will automatically disable all other enabled fields on behalf of the user.
- Otherwise, for fields like a [select](select), [radio](radio), [checkbox list](checkbox-list), or [toggle buttons](toggle-buttons), when a user selects an option, Filament will automatically deselect all other usages of that option on behalf of the user.

#### Disabling options when they are already selected in another item

If you'd like to disable options in a [select](select), [radio](radio), [checkbox list](checkbox-list), or [toggle buttons](toggle-buttons) when they are already selected in another item, you can use the `disableOptionsWhenSelectedInSiblingRepeaterItems()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        Select::make('role')
            ->options([
                // ...
            ])
            ->disableOptionsWhenSelectedInSiblingRepeaterItems(),
    ])
```

This method will automatically enable the `distinct()` and `live()` methods on the field.

## Customizing the repeater item actions

This field uses action objects for easy customization of buttons within it. You can customize these buttons by passing a function to an action registration method. The function has access to the `$action` object, which you can use to [customize it](../../actions/trigger-button). The following methods are available to customize the actions:

- `addAction()`
- `cloneAction()`
- `collapseAction()`
- `collapseAllAction()`
- `deleteAction()`
- `expandAction()`
- `expandAllAction()`
- `moveDownAction()`
- `moveUpAction()`
- `reorderAction()`

Here is an example of how you might customize an action:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapseAllAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->label('Collapse all members'),
    )
```

### Confirming repeater actions with a modal

You can confirm actions with a modal by using the `requiresConfirmation()` method on the action object. You may use any [modal customization method](../../actions/modals) to change its content and behavior:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->deleteAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->requiresConfirmation(),
    )
```

> The `collapseAction()`, `collapseAllAction()`, `expandAction()`, `expandAllAction()` and `reorderAction()` methods do not support confirmation modals, as clicking their buttons does not make the network request that is required to show the modal.

### Adding extra item actions to a repeater

You may add new [action buttons](../actions) to the header of each repeater item by passing `Action` objects into `extraItemActions()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->label('Email address')
            ->email(),
        // ...
    ])
    ->extraItemActions([
        Action::make('sendEmail')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope')
            ->action(function (array $arguments, Repeater $component): void {
                $itemData = $component->getItemState($arguments['item']);

                Mail::to($itemData['email'])
                    ->send(
                        // ...
                    );
            }),
    ])
```

In this example, `$arguments['item']` gives you the ID of the current repeater item. You can validate the data in that repeater item using the `getItemState()` method on the repeater component. This method returns the validated data for the item. If the item is not valid, it will cancel the action and show an error message for that item in the form.

If you want to get the raw data from the current item without validating it, you can use `$component->getRawItemState($arguments['item'])` instead.

If you want to manipulate the raw data for the entire repeater, for example, to add, remove or modify items, you can use `$component->getState()` to get the data, and `$component->state($state)` to set it again:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

// Get the raw data for the entire repeater
$state = $component->getState();

// Add an item, with a random UUID as the key
$state[Str::uuid()] = [
    'email' => auth()->user()->email,
];

// Set the new data for the repeater
$component->state($state);
```

## Testing repeaters

Internally, repeaters generate UUIDs for items to keep track of them in the Livewire HTML easier. This means that when you are testing a form with a repeater, you need to ensure that the UUIDs are consistent between the form and the test. This can be tricky, and if you don't do it correctly, your tests can fail as the tests are expecting a UUID, not a numeric key.

However, since Livewire doesn't need to keep track of the UUIDs in a test, you can disable the UUID generation and replace them with numeric keys, using the `Repeater::fake()` method at the start of your test:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

$undoRepeaterFake = Repeater::fake();

livewire(EditPost::class, ['record' => $post])
    ->assertFormSet([
        'quotes' => [
            [
                'content' => 'First quote',
            ],
            [
                'content' => 'Second quote',
            ],
        ],
        // ...
    ]);

$undoRepeaterFake();
```

You may also find it useful to test the number of items in a repeater by passing a function to the `assertFormSet()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

$undoRepeaterFake = Repeater::fake();

livewire(EditPost::class, ['record' => $post])
    ->assertFormSet(function (array $state) {
        expect($state['quotes'])
            ->toHaveCount(2);
    });

$undoRepeaterFake();
```

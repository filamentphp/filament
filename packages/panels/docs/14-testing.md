title: Testing
---

## Overview

All examples in this guide will be written using [Pest](https://pestphp.com). To use Pest's Livewire plugin for testing, you can follow the installation instructions in the Pest documentation on plugins: [Livewire plugin for Pest](https://pestphp.com/docs/plugins#livewire). However, you can easily adapt this to PHPUnit.

Since all pages in the app are Livewire components, we're just using Livewire testing helpers everywhere. If you've never tested Livewire components before, please read [this guide](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/testing) from the Livewire docs.

## Getting started

Ensure that you are authenticated to access the app in your `TestCase`:

```php
protected function setUp(): void
{
    parent::setUp();

    $this->actingAs(User::factory()->create());
}
```

### Testing multiple panels

If you have multiple panels and you would like to test a non-default panel, you will need to tell Filament which panel you are testing. This can be done in the `setUp()` method of the test case, or you can do it at the start of a particular test. Filament usually does this in a middleware when you access the panel through a request, so if you're not making a request in your test like when testing a Livewire component, you need to set the current panel manually:

```php
use Filament\Facades\Filament;

Filament::setCurrentPanel(
    Filament::getPanel('app'), // Where `app` is the ID of the panel you want to test.
);
```

## Resources

### Pages

#### List

##### Routing & render

To ensure that the List page for the `PostResource` is able to render successfully, generate a page URL, perform a request to this URL and ensure that it is successful:

```php
it('can render page', function () {
    $this->get(PostResource::getUrl('index'))->assertSuccessful();
});
```

##### Table

Filament includes a selection of helpers for testing tables. A full guide to testing tables can be found [in the Table Builder documentation](../tables/testing).

To use a table [testing helper](../tables/testing), make assertions on the resource's List page class, which holds the table:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can list posts', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts);
});
```

#### Create

##### Routing & render

To ensure that the Create page for the `PostResource` is able to render successfully, generate a page URL, perform a request to this URL and ensure that it is successful:

```php
it('can render page', function () {
    $this->get(PostResource::getUrl('create'))->assertSuccessful();
});
```

##### Creating

You may check that data is correctly saved into the database by calling `fillForm()` with your form data, and then asserting that the database contains a matching record:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can create', function () {
    $newData = Post::factory()->make();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\CreatePost::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'author_id' => $newData->author->getKey(),
            'content' => $newData->content,
            'tags' => $newData->tags,
            'title' => $newData->title,
        ])
        ->call('create')
        ->assertHasNoFormErrors();

    $this->assertDatabaseHas(Post::class, [
        'author_id' => $newData->author->getKey(),
        'content' => $newData->content,
        'tags' => json_encode($newData->tags),
        'title' => $newData->title,
    ]);
});
```

##### Validation

Use `assertHasFormErrors()` to ensure that data is properly validated in a form:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can validate input', function () {
    livewire(PostResource\Pages\CreatePost::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'title' => null,
        ])
        ->call('create')
        ->assertHasFormErrors(['title' => 'required']);
});
```

#### Edit

##### Routing & render

To ensure that the Edit page for the `PostResource` is able to render successfully, generate a page URL, perform a request to this URL and ensure that it is successful:

```php
it('can render page', function () {
    $this->get(PostResource::getUrl('edit', [
        'record' => Post::factory()->create(),
    ]))->assertSuccessful();
});
```

##### Filling existing data

To check that the form is filled with the correct data from the database, you may `assertFormSet()` that the data in the form matches that of the record:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can retrieve data', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\EditPost::class, [
        'record' => $post->getRouteKey(),
    ])
        ->assertFormSet([
            'author_id' => $post->author->getKey(),
            'content' => $post->content,
            'tags' => $post->tags,
            'title' => $post->title,
        ]);
});
```

##### Saving

You may check that data is correctly saved into the database by calling `fillForm()` with your form data, and then asserting that the database contains a matching record:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can save', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();
    $newData = Post::factory()->make();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\EditPost::class, [
        'record' => $post->getRouteKey(),
    ])
        ->fillForm([
            'author_id' => $newData->author->getKey(),
            'content' => $newData->content,
            'tags' => $newData->tags,
            'title' => $newData->title,
        ])
        ->call('save')
        ->assertHasNoFormErrors();

    expect($post->refresh())
        ->author_id->toBe($newData->author->getKey())
        ->content->toBe($newData->content)
        ->tags->toBe($newData->tags)
        ->title->toBe($newData->title);
});
```

##### Validation

Use `assertHasFormErrors()` to ensure that data is properly validated in a form:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can validate input', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\EditPost::class, [
        'record' => $post->getRouteKey(),
    ])
        ->fillForm([
            'title' => null,
        ])
        ->call('save')
        ->assertHasFormErrors(['title' => 'required']);
});
```

##### Deleting

You can test the `DeleteAction` using `callAction()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can delete', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\EditPost::class, [
        'record' => $post->getRouteKey(),
    ])
        ->callAction(DeleteAction::class);

    $this->assertModelMissing($post);
});
```

You can ensure that a particular user is not able to see a `DeleteAction` using `assertActionHidden()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can not delete', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\EditPost::class, [
        'record' => $post->getRouteKey(),
    ])
        ->assertActionHidden(DeleteAction::class);
});
```

#### View

##### Routing & render

To ensure that the View page for the `PostResource` is able to render successfully, generate a page URL, perform a request to this URL and ensure that it is successful:

```php
it('can render page', function () {
    $this->get(PostResource::getUrl('view', [
        'record' => Post::factory()->create(),
    ]))->assertSuccessful();
});
```

##### Filling existing data

To check that the form is filled with the correct data from the database, you may `assertFormSet()` that the data in the form matches that of the record:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can retrieve data', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ViewPost::class, [
        'record' => $post->getRouteKey(),
    ])
        ->assertFormSet([
            'author_id' => $post->author->getKey(),
            'content' => $post->content,
            'tags' => $post->tags,
            'title' => $post->title,
        ]);
});
```

### Relation managers

##### Render

To ensure that a relation manager is able to render successfully, mount the Livewire component:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\CategoryResource\Pages\EditCategory;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can render relation manager', function () {
    $category = Category::factory()
        ->has(Post::factory()->count(10))
        ->create();

    livewire(CategoryResource\RelationManagers\PostsRelationManager::class, [
        'ownerRecord' => $category,
        'pageClass' => EditCategory::class,
    ])
        ->assertSuccessful();
});
```

##### Table

Filament includes a selection of helpers for testing tables. A full guide to testing tables can be found [in the Table Builder documentation](../tables/testing).

To use a table [testing helper](../tables/testing), make assertions on the relation manager class, which holds the table:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\CategoryResource\Pages\EditCategory;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can list posts', function () {
    $category = Category::factory()
        ->has(Post::factory()->count(10))
        ->create();

    livewire(CategoryResource\RelationManagers\PostsRelationManager::class, [
        'ownerRecord' => $category,
        'pageClass' => EditCategory::class,
    ])
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($category->posts);
});
```

## Overview

Filament uses CSS variables to define its color palette. These CSS variables are mapped to Tailwind classes in the preset file that you load when installing Filament.

## Customizing the default colors

From a service provider's `boot()` method, or middleware, you can call the `FilamentColor::register()` method, which you can use to customize which colors Filament uses for UI elements.

There are 6 default colors that are used throughout Filament that you are able to customize:

```php
use Filament\Support\Colors\Color;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentColor;

FilamentColor::register([
    'danger' => Color::Red,
    'gray' => Color::Zinc,
    'info' => Color::Blue,
    'primary' => Color::Amber,
    'success' => Color::Green,
    'warning' => Color::Amber,
]);
```

The `Color` class contains every [Tailwind CSS color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#color-palette-reference) to choose from.

You can also pass in a function to `register()` which will only get called when the app is getting rendered. This is useful if you are calling `register()` from a service provider, and want to access objects like the currently authenticated user, which are initialized later in middleware.

## Using a non-Tailwind color

You can use custom colors that are not included in the [Tailwind CSS color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#color-palette-reference) palette by passing an array of color shades from `50` to `950` in RGB format:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentColor;

FilamentColor::register([
    'danger' => [
        50 => '254, 242, 242',
        100 => '254, 226, 226',
        200 => '254, 202, 202',
        300 => '252, 165, 165',
        400 => '248, 113, 113',
        500 => '239, 68, 68',
        600 => '220, 38, 38',
        700 => '185, 28, 28',
        800 => '153, 27, 27',
        900 => '127, 29, 29',
        950 => '69, 10, 10',
    ],
]);
```

### Generating a custom color from a hex code

You can use the `Color::hex()` method to generate a custom color palette from a hex code:

```php
use Filament\Support\Colors\Color;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentColor;

FilamentColor::register([
    'danger' => Color::hex('#ff0000'),
]);
```

### Generating a custom color from an RGB value

You can use the `Color::rgb()` method to generate a custom color palette from an RGB value:

```php
use Filament\Support\Colors\Color;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentColor;

FilamentColor::register([
    'danger' => Color::rgb('rgb(255, 0, 0)'),
]);
```

## Registering extra colors

You can register extra colors that you can use throughout Filament:

```php
use Filament\Support\Colors\Color;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentColor;

FilamentColor::register([
    'indigo' => Color::Indigo,
]);
```

Now, you can use this color anywhere you would normally add `primary`, `danger`, etc.

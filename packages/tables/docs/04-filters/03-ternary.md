title: Ternary filters
---

## Overview

Ternary filters allow you to easily create a select filter which has three states - usually true, false and blank. To filter a column named `is_admin` to be `true` or `false`, you may use the ternary filter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TernaryFilter;

TernaryFilter::make('is_admin')
```

## Using a ternary filter with a nullable column

Another common pattern is to use a nullable column. For example, when filtering verified and unverified users using the `email_verified_at` column, unverified users have a null timestamp in this column. To apply that logic, you may use the `nullable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TernaryFilter;

TernaryFilter::make('email_verified_at')
    ->nullable()
```

## Customizing the column used by a ternary filter

The column name used to scope the query is the name of the filter. To customize this, you may use the `attribute()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TernaryFilter;

TernaryFilter::make('verified')
    ->nullable()
    ->attribute('status_id')
```

## Customizing the ternary filter option labels

You may customize the labels used for each state of the ternary filter. The true option label can be customized using the `trueLabel()` method. The false option label can be customized using the `falseLabel()` method. The blank (default) option label can be customized using the `placeholder()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TernaryFilter;

TernaryFilter::make('email_verified_at')
    ->label('Email verification')
    ->nullable()
    ->placeholder('All users')
    ->trueLabel('Verified users')
    ->falseLabel('Not verified users')
```

## Customizing how a ternary filter modifies the query

You may customize how the query changes for each state of the ternary filter, use the `queries()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TernaryFilter;

TernaryFilter::make('email_verified_at')
    ->label('Email verification')
    ->placeholder('All users')
    ->trueLabel('Verified users')
    ->falseLabel('Not verified users')
    ->queries(
        true: fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereNotNull('email_verified_at'),
        false: fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereNull('email_verified_at'),
        blank: fn (Builder $query) => $query, // In this example, we do not want to filter the query when it is blank.
    )
```

## Filtering soft deletable records

The `TrashedFilter` can be used to filter soft deleted records. It is a type of ternary filter that is built-in to Filament. You can use it like so:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TrashedFilter;

TrashedFilter::make()
```

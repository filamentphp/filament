title: Broadcast notifications
---

## Overview

> To start, make sure the package is [installed](installation) - `@livewire('notifications')` should be in your Blade layout somewhere.

By default, Filament will send flash notifications via the Laravel session. However, you may wish that your notifications are "broadcast" to a user in real-time, instead. This could be used to send a temporary success notification from a queued job after it has finished processing.

We have a native integration with [Laravel Echo](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting#client-side-installation). Make sure Echo is installed, as well as a [server-side websockets integration](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting#server-side-installation) like Pusher.

## Sending broadcast notifications

There are several ways to send broadcast notifications, depending on which one suits you best.

You may use our fluent API:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

$recipient = auth()->user();

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->broadcast($recipient);
```

Or, use the `notify()` method:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

$recipient = auth()->user();

$recipient->notify(
    Notification::make()
        ->title('Saved successfully')
        ->toBroadcast(),
)
```

Alternatively, use a traditional [Laravel notification class](https://laravel.com/docs/notifications#generating-notifications) by returning the notification from the `toBroadcast()` method:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\BroadcastMessage;

public function toBroadcast(User $notifiable): BroadcastMessage
{
    return Notification::make()
        ->title('Saved successfully')
        ->getBroadcastMessage();
}
```

title: Installation
---

**The Widgets package is pre-installed with the [Panel Builder](/docs/panels).** This guide is for using the Widgets package in a custom TALL Stack application (Tailwind, Alpine, Livewire, Laravel).

## Requirements

Filament requires the following to run:

- PHP 8.1+
- Laravel v10.0+
- Livewire v3.0+

> **Livewire v3 is recently released!**<br />
> The Livewire team have done a great job in making it stable, but it was a complete rewrite of Livewire v2. You may encounter issues, so we recommend testing your application thoroughly before using Filament v3 in production.

## Installation

Require the Widgets package using Composer:

```bash
composer require filament/widgets:"^3.1" -W
```

## New Laravel projects

To quickly get started with Filament in a new Laravel project, run the following commands to install [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com), [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com):

> Since these commands will overwrite existing files in your application, only run this in a new Laravel project!

```bash
php artisan filament:install --scaffold --widgets

npm install

npm run dev
```

## Existing Laravel projects

Run the following command to install the Widgets package assets:

```bash
php artisan filament:install --widgets
```

### Installing Tailwind CSS

Run the following command to install Tailwind CSS with the Tailwind Forms and Typography plugins:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/forms @tailwindcss/typography postcss postcss-nesting autoprefixer --save-dev
```

Create a new `tailwind.config.js` file and add the Filament `preset` *(includes the Filament color scheme and the required Tailwind plugins)*:

```js
import preset from './vendor/filament/support/tailwind.config.preset'

export default {
    presets: [preset],
    content: [
        './app/Filament/**/*.php',
        './resources/views/filament/**/*.blade.php',
        './vendor/filament/**/*.blade.php',
    ],
}
```

### Configuring styles

Add Tailwind's CSS layers to your `resources/css/app.css`:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Create a `postcss.config.js` file in the root of your project and register Tailwind CSS, PostCSS Nesting and Autoprefixer as plugins:

```js
export default {
    plugins: {
        'tailwindcss/nesting': 'postcss-nesting',
        tailwindcss: {},
        autoprefixer: {},
    },
}
```

### Automatically refreshing the browser
You may also want to update your `vite.config.js` file to refresh the page automatically when Livewire components are updated:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import laravel, { refreshPaths } from 'laravel-vite-plugin'

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel({
            input: ['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'],
            refresh: [
                ...refreshPaths,
                'app/Livewire/**',
            ],
        }),
    ],
})
```

### Compiling assets

Compile your new CSS and Javascript assets using `npm run dev`.

### Configuring your layout

Create a new `resources/views/components/layouts/app.blade.php` layout file for Livewire components:

```blade
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">

        <meta name="application-name" content="{{ config('app.name') }}">
        <meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

        <title>{{ config('app.name') }}</title>

        <style>
            [x-cloak] {
                display: none !important;
            }
        </style>

        @filamentStyles
        @vite('resources/css/app.css')
    </head>

    <body class="antialiased">
        {{ $slot }}

        @filamentScripts
        @vite('resources/js/app.js')
    </body>
</html>
```

## Publishing configuration

You can publish the package configuration using the following command (optional):

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-config
```

## Upgrading

Filament automatically upgrades to the latest non-breaking version when you run `composer update`. After any updates, all Laravel caches need to be cleared, and frontend assets need to be republished. You can do this all at once using the `filament:upgrade` command, which should have been added to your `composer.json` file when you ran `filament:install` the first time:

```json
"post-autoload-dump": [
    // ...
    "@php artisan filament:upgrade"
],
```

Please note that `filament:upgrade` does not actually handle the update process, as Composer does that already. If you're upgrading manually without a `post-autoload-dump` hook, you can run the command yourself:

```bash
composer update

php artisan filament:upgrade
```

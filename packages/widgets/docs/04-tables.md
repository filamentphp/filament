title: Table widgets
---

When using the [Panel Builder](../panels), you can use table widgets. These use the [table builder](../tables). You can find out how to create them [here](../panels/dashboard#table-widgets).

If you're not using the Panel Builder, there's no need to use a "widget" to render a table. You can simply [add a table to a Livewire component](../tables/adding-a-table-to-a-livewire-component), which does not provide any specific benefits over a widget.
